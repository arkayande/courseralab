 are thousands of interesting Jupyter Notebooks available on the 
internet for you to learn from. One of the best sources is: <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki</a></p><p>It
 is important to notice that you can download such notebooks to your 
local computer or import them to a cloud based notebook tool so that you
 can rerun, modify, and apply what's explained in the notebook.</p><p>Very
 often, Jupyter Notebooks are already shared in a rendered view. This 
means that you can look at them as if they were running locally on your 
machine. But sometimes, folks only share a link to the Jupyter file 
(which you can make out by the *.ipynb extension). In this case, you can
 pick the URL to that file and paste it to the NB-Viewer =&gt; <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/</a></p><p>The
 list of Jupyter Notebooks provides you with a huge collection of 
materials to explore. Therefore, it might be useful to give you some 
pointers to interesting notebooks. You have covered some examples with 
data in the labs. Let's highlight some useful data that further explores
 data science. In addition, as we have covered different tasks in data 
science, we will also provide a sample notebook for each task.</p><p>First, you start with exploratory data analysis, for which this notebook is highly recommended: <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb</a></p><p>For
 data integration/cleansing at a smaller scale, the python 
library_pandas_is often used. For this task, you can have a look at this
 notebook: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-with-python-using-pandas-library-c6f4a68ea8eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-with-python-using-pandas-library-c6f4a68ea8eb</a></p><p>If you want to know more about clustering, have a look at this notebook: <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/2%20-%20KMeans.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/2%20-%20KMeans.ipynb</a></p><p>And finally, if you want an in-depth notebook on the_iris_dataset, have a look at this: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lalitharajesh/iris-dataset-exploratory-data-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.kaggle.com/lalitharajesh/iris-dataset-exploratory-data-analysis</a></p><h3><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Author(s)</h3><h4> Romeo Kienzler </h4><h4></h4><p><img src="nbshtm_files/footerLatest.png" alt=""></p></body></html>
